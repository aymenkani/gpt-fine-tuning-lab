# GPT Fine-Tuning Lab

This project demonstrates fine-tuning of GPT models using **PyTorch** and **Hugging Face Transformers**.  
The notebook walks through dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and pushing the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub.

## Contents
- `gpt_fine-tuning-with-pytorch_and_transformers__plus_descriptions.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and explanations.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for running the notebook.

## Trained Model
The fine-tuned model is available on my Hugging Face profile:
